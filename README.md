## Introduction

Stock market prediction is a challenging and important task in finance. This project aims to predict stock prices using historical data and an LSTM-based deep learning model. It serves as an example of how to approach time series prediction tasks in finance.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `stock_prediction.py`: The main Python script that loads data, preprocesses it, builds the LSTM model, and generates predictions.
- `README.md`: This documentation file explaining the project and how to use it.
- `stock_prediction_plot.png`: A sample plot of the stock price predictions.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tanishq20011430/college/stock-market-prediction.git
   cd stock-market-prediction
pip install numpy pandas yfinance matplotlib scikit-learn keras
Usage
To run the project and generate stock price predictions:

bash
Copy code
python stock_prediction.py
This will load data, preprocess it, train an LSTM model, and produce prediction plots.

Results
The project will generate prediction plots that show actual stock prices, training predictions, and testing predictions. You can analyze these plots to assess the model's performance.
